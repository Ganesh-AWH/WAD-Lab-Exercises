          The dog is a pet animal. A dog has sharp teeth so that it can eat flesh very easily, it has four legs, two ears, two eyes, a tail, a mouth,   
          and a nose.

          It is a very clever animal and is very useful in catching thieves. It runs very fast, barks loudly and attacks the strangers.

        <h4>The Alternative CSS Box Model</h1>
        <p class="heading-content">
          The CSS box model is a set of rules that decides how a CSS element's sizes are computed as you add padding, borders, and margins around the content.By default, browsers use the standard box model. To switch to an alternative model, add the box-sizing:border-box declaration to your CSS.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row-1">
        <p class="row-1-text">
          The box-sizing:border-box model has many advantages, especially when it comes to flexible layouts. A better box model would be no box model at all, or rather no dependence on any particular box model that happens to be in use.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row-2">
        <p class="row-2-text">
          To use the alternative box model for all of your elements (which is a common choice among developers), set the box-sizing property on the html element and set all other elements to inherit that value.
